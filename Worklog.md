Running record of repository work. Newest entries first.

### 7 November 2026, 14:40 America/New_York (19:40 UTC)

- **Who:** Mert
- **Done:** Started Mert’s packages: contract 1.0 types and fixtures, a Postgres draft, the read API, the dashboard, and the investigation brief. Named Mert and Carter on the work-package table. Left Carter’s vision and emissions paths untouched.
- **Completed:** Live, replay, and synthetic modes stay separate. Empty emissions stay unavailable rather than zero. The dashboard shows four cameras, stale versus offline status, a shorter-stop scenario without invented grams, an empty review queue, and a draft brief that is not sent. Backend checks pass, and the dashboard build passes.
- **Still open:** No worker heartbeat, no valid calibration, no CARB factor table, no hosted database, and no GPU run. Queue length in metres and speed stay suppressed. The synthetic minute is only a labeled sample.

### 7 November 2026, 14:34 America/New_York (19:34 UTC)

- **Who:** Carter
- **Done:** Removed the global `*.ts` rule from `.gitignore`, which was hiding TypeScript source. Added ignores for evaluation frames, Ultralytics `runs/` output, and TensorRT and OpenVINO model exports.
- **Completed:** TypeScript files can be committed. Sampled frames and exported models stay out of the public repo.
- **Still open:** Carter needs push access. Empire AI GPU test is with Mert. The rest of `Plan.md` §21 is unchanged.

### 7 November 2026, 14:28 America/New_York (19:28 UTC)

- **Who:** Mert
- **Done:** Updated `Agents.md` and `Plan.md` §15 so every turn must timestamp completed work, speak only as Mert and Carter, and push when nothing looks broken. Added this worklog.
- **Completed:** The every-turn logging, attribution, and push rules are written into the agent instructions and the master plan.
- **Still open:** The rest of the immediate unresolved items in `Plan.md` §21. No application or GPU work in this turn.
